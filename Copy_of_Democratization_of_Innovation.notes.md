# Chapter 1 - Introduction and Overview

Democratization of innovation means that users are able to create innovation (solve their own problems) for themselves.

An important aspect of user innovation is that the user that has an unmet problem can solve it to fit their own need,
without relying on firms that try to solve a more generic problem.

User innovation happens as well as in the software industry as well as for physical products. Think of skateboards etc..

What/who is a user? A user is an individual or firm *using* a product or service.

In contrast to manufacturers, who expect to benefit from *selling* the product.




# Chapter 2 - Development of Products by Lead Users

# Many users innovate

Studies show that between 10% and 40% of users adapt a product to their needs, which leads to user innovation.

## Lead user theory

A lead user is a member of user group using products at the leading edge of the market trends and are experiencing
needs that probably will later be experienced by others.

Various studies show the existence of lead users in the market.

## Innovation in Industrial Product User Firms

Von Hippel held a study around 1988 about the lead user innovation in Printed Circuit - CAD. The survey clearly
showed that about a quarter of user were lead users. In other words, these users were not satisfied by the current
capabilities fo the product and were likely to improve it and bring user innovation.

## “Consumer” Innovation in Sports Communities

Users of four sport groups were interviewed:

- canoying
- sailsplaning
- Baordercross
- cyclist with handicaps

A third of users across these sport groups reported cases of user innovation, that led to improvements or adaptions
of their sports equipment.

## Discussion

Studies have shown that user innovations in general and commercially attractive innovations tend to be developed by lead users.
