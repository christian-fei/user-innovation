# Chapter 1 - Introduction and Overview

Democratization of innovation means that users are able to create innovation (solve their own problems) for themselves.

An important aspect of user innovation is that the user that has an unmet problem can solve it to fit their own need,
without relying on firms that try to solve a more generic problem.

User innovation happens as well as in the software industry as well as for physical products. Think of skateboards etc..

What/who is a user? A user is an individual or firm *using* a product or service.

In contrast to manufacturers, who expect to benefit from *selling* the product.
